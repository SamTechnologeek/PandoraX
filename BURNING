To try out PandoraX in real hardware, you can use a pendrive, and pandorax.img,
run the following command with root powers:

Note: I am assuming your usb stick is in /dev/sdb , make sure where
yours is, if you just execute this command without making sure it's your usb
stick you might delete another drive! :

  dd if=pandorax.img of=/dev/sdb

This will copy the image to the USB, now you can put it in a computer's USB
port, and set the BIOS so that it boots from the USB stick.

Happy Hacking!
